    <p>This project consists of an 8-hour event where the participants (some in teams), will compete to make the best MCPE C++ native mod, while streaming it in Twitch/Shou, so our viewers can spectate their progress, and monitor if any member is cheating. There is <strong>NO</strong>prize set *yet*.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What is permitted and what isn't?</strong></p>
    <p>It is extremely prohibited to copy paste other's code, although you can use previosly created APIs and headers. During the stream, there should be no interruptions, although it isn't necessary to have microphones on.</p>
    </section>
    
    <p><strong>When does it start?</strong></p>
    <p>It will start on August 1st 2015, after 0.12.0 is released, so modders can have more symbols to mod.</p>
